# Linked List
`A  linked list is a data structure that consist of nodes, where each node contains a data and a reference pointer to the next node `
- Entry point to linked list is called as head
- If list is empty the head is null reference
- 
### Types of linked list 
- [[Singly Linked Lists]] - nodes point only to the next node
- [[Doubly Linked List]]- node point to both next and previous nodes
- [[Circular linked list]] : last node points back to the first node
### Advantage of linked lists over array
- Dynamic size : can grow and shrink at runtime
- Efficient insertions and deletion - especially at the beginning and at the end

### Disadvantage of a linked list
- No direct access to the elements it is sequential access only
- Uses extra memory for pointers
